**adjTomo** (*an abbreviation of 'adjoint tomography'*) is an organization for tools related to the scientific problems of 
seismic imaging, adjoint tomography and full waveform inversion. These tools are Python-based, open-source and community driven. 

Although independent, the adjTomo organization is intimately intertwined with the open-source numerical solver, [SPECFEM](specfem.org). 

Want to contribute, discuss or ask questions? Check out the [adjTomo Discussions Tab](https://github.com/orgs/adjtomo/discussions), or open an issue or pull request in any of the individual repositories.  

-----------------

The **main** repositories in this organization are:

- [SeisFlows](github.com/adjtomo/seisflows): An automated workflow tool for full waveform inversion and adjoint tomography   
- [Pyatoa](github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa): A misfit assessment and visualization toolbox for full waveform tomography   
- [PySEP](github.com/adjtomo/pysep): Seismic data (waveforms and metadata) retrieval program with built-in record section plotter  

Auxiliary repositories include:

- [adjDocs](github.com/adjtomo/adjdocs): Workshop and teaching materials related to adjTomo packages and SPECFEM
- [PyFlex](github.com/adjtomo/pyflex)*: A Python port of FLEXWIN, automated window picking algorithm for seismic imaging 
- [PyAdjoint](github.com/adjtomo/pyadjoint)*: Waveform misfit functionals and adjoint source generation

*\* These packages are wrapped by Pyatoa and do not need to be installed or called standalone*
