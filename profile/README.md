**adjTomo** (*an abbreviation of 'adjoint tomography'*) is an organization for tools related to the scientific problems of 
seismic imaging, adjoint tomography and full waveform inversion. These tools are Python-based, open-source and community driven. 

Although independent, the adjTomo organization is connected with the open-source numerical solver, [SPECFEM](https://specfem.org). 

Want to contribute, discuss or ask questions? Check out the [adjTomo Discussions Tab](https://github.com/orgs/adjtomo/discussions), or open an issue or pull request in any of the individual repositories. 

All contributions are welcome! Have a look at this [Contributor's guide](https://pyatoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) to see how you can help improve adjTomo.

-----------------

The **main** repositories in this organization are:

- [SeisFlows](https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows): An automated workflow tool for full waveform inversion and adjoint tomography   
- [Pyatoa](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa): A misfit assessment and visualization toolbox for full waveform tomography   
- [PySEP](https://github.com/adjtomo/pysep): Seismic data (waveforms and metadata) retrieval program with built-in record section plotter  

Auxiliary repositories include:

- [adjDocs](https://github.com/adjtomo/adjdocs): Workshop and teaching materials related to adjTomo packages and SPECFEM
- [wfdiff](https://github.com/adjtomo/wfdiff): **W**ave**f**orm **diff**erencing to determine finite-element mesh minimum resolvable period  
- [PyFlex](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyflex)*: A Python port of FLEXWIN, automated window picking algorithm for seismic imaging 
- [Pyadjoint](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyadjoint)*: Waveform misfit functions and adjoint source generation

*\* These packages are wrapped into Pyatoa and do not need to be installed or called standalone*
